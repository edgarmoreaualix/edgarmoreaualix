# Edgar Moreau

I build AI-powered tools for local businesses in France.

Formerly in DeFi and blockchain, I helped build [FujiDAO](https://github.com/Fujicracy).  
Today I use Claude Code, ChatGPT Codex, and AI workflows to ship products faster and turn ideas into working tools.

## Focus now

- Build practical AI systems for restaurants and local businesses
- Improve day-to-day operations, visibility, and growth
- Ship fast, iterate from real usage, and keep tools simple for teams

## Current apps

- **EzBoost**  
  Context-based ad creation and publishing on Meta Ads for restaurants.
- **MenuBoost**  
  Transcribes restaurant whiteboards into menus directly published on their website, saving time for teams.

## How I work

1. Clarify business outcome (revenue, retention, or time saved)
2. Scope a lean version with measurable impact
3. Ship quickly with AI-assisted development
4. Iterate from real usage and data

## Focus in 2026

- Publish more local-business case studies with before/after metrics
- Productize reusable AI tools for restaurants
- Build a reputation for reliable AI delivery in France

## Philosophy

I am deeply curious and optimistic about what AI enables.  
I used to be "the idea guy." Now I ship those ideas fast and turn them into real products.

## Work with me
