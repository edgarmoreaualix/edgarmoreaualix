# Edgar Moreau

I build AI-powered tools for local businesses.

I work with restaurants, bars, and small service teams to improve bookings, retention, and operations with practical systems that ship fast.

## What I do

- Automate repetitive operations (booking flow, follow-ups, reporting)
- Build internal tools and dashboards for teams
- Turn business ideas into working products in days, not months
- Combine strategy + execution with Claude Code and Codex

## Current projects

- [le_cafe_du_marche](https://github.com/edgarmoreaualix/le_cafe_du_marche) - Website and digital presence for a local venue
- [lecafedumarche](https://github.com/edgarmoreaualix/lecafedumarche) - TypeScript implementation for product iteration
- [agence](https://github.com/edgarmoreaualix/agence) - Agency workspace and delivery assets
- [mypersonalwebsite](https://github.com/edgarmoreaualix/mypersonalwebsite) - Personal brand site

## How I work

1. Clarify business outcome (revenue, retention, or time saved)
2. Scope a lean version with measurable impact
3. Ship quickly with AI-assisted development
4. Iterate from real usage and data

## Focus in 2026

- Publish more case studies with before/after metrics
- Productize reusable tools for local businesses
- Build a reputation for reliable AI delivery
