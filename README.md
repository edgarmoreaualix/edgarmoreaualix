# Hi, I'm Edgar Moreau! 🦆

I am a product-manager empowered by AI and based in France. 🇫🇷

Formerly in DeFi and blockchain, I co-founded [FujiDAO](https://github.com/Fujicracy) the first borrowing on-chain borrowing aggregator. 🗻  
Today I use Claude Code, ChatGPT Codex, and AI workflows to ship products faster and turn ideas into working tools.

## Focus now 🎯

- Build practical AI systems for restaurants and local businesses 🍽️
- Improve day-to-day operations, visibility, and growth 📈
- Ship fast, iterate from real usage, and keep tools simple for teams ⚡

## Current apps 🚀

- **EzBoost** 📣  
  Context-based ad creation and publishing on Meta Ads for restaurants.
- **MenuBoost** 🧾  
  Transcribes restaurant whiteboards into menus directly published on their website, saving time for teams.

## How I work 🛠️

1. Clarify business outcome (revenue, retention, or time saved)
2. Scope a lean version with measurable impact
3. Ship quickly with AI-assisted development
4. Iterate from real usage and data

## Focus in 2026 🔭

- Publish more local-business case studies with before/after metrics
- Productize reusable AI tools for restaurants
- Build a reputation for reliable AI delivery in France

## Philosophy 🧠

I am deeply curious and optimistic about what AI enables.  
I used to be "the idea guy." Now I ship those ideas fast and turn them into real products.
